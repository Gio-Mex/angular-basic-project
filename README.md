## Description
This is a simple application based on the official Angular documentation, with some small variations and the use of Angular Material. This is a small representation of an e-commerce website, where you can consult a short catalog of products, add them to your cart and simulate their purchase.

## Installation
If you're using OS X or Windows, use one of the installers from the [Node.js download page](https://nodejs.org/en/download/). Be sure to install the version labeled LTS. Other versions have not yet been tested with npm.

Then, you can install the Angular CLI:
```bash
npm install -g @angular/cli
```

Now run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to http://localhost:4200/. The application will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.
